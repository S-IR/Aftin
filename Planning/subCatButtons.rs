What I want to happen :
When the user clicks on the download button the code should first check if he can download the image and then proceed further.
When the user clicks on the edit image button he should get redirected to the image editor with his desired image appearing to be edited. Then some other general elements should appear
When the person is sent to the preview part he should see the image being displayed in different canvas environments with maybe some utilities
When the user has clicked on download but he is not logged in yet we should save his desired image and then show it when he finished authenticating
